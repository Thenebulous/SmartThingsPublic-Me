Zooz Zen22 Dimmer V2

This is the new version 2 of the Zooz Zen22 Dimmer

There are some important differences between this and the previous version.

First, the firmware bug has been fixed! But, more importantly, this will now work with a REGULAR 3 way switch and existing wiring! The other 3 way switch just becomes a toggle and will only control on/off but not dimming but it's a really nice feature!

Second, there is now the ability to turn off the LED completely if you like.

And there is a very audible and tactile click on either paddle direction.

Finally, they are now including a short neutral wire ala jasco, which is a nice little plus!

How to use the control:

Single press on the top turns it on, single press on the bottom turns it off. The "bottom" is the side with the LED, but you can invert the switch with parameters. Long press will change the dim level when the light is on. The previous dim level will be resumed when the light is turned back on. Long press on when the light is off will turn to full brightness, regardless of previous level, after about 2 seconds. There is no control for the dimming speed.

There are 3 parameters for this device:

Parameter 1 (1 byte) - Invert Switch - When on, this inverts the switch so that the bottom (side by the LED) actually turns the switch on. The default is for this to be off

Parameter 2 (1 byte) - LED indicator - When this is turned on, the LED will follow the light and only be on when the light is on. Normal operation (parameter off) is that the LED is only on when the light is off

Parameter 3 (1 byte) - LED Disable   - When this parameter is on, the LED light is completely disabled
